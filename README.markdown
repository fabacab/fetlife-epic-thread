# FetLife Epic Thread

The FetLife Epic Thread user script makes reading long, passionate discussions on FetLife.com easier by adding comment threading for @-replies, a "previous/next" link for related comments, and visual highlights. Instead of needing to scroll past a bunch of unrelated comments, simply click the "Next in thread on page" link to go to the next comment in the thread. Rather than having to scroll up or copy-and-paste to see what a comment is replying to, click the "in reply to" link to see the original comment right under your cursor.

After you post your comment, other users will be presented with an "in reply to" link in your comment.

Clicking on the "in reply to" link will show the comment you've replied to, as shown below:

A "Previous in thread on page" link will also be added to your comment, allowing readers to jump back to the previous comment. Additionally, a "Next in thread on page" link will be added to the comment you replied to, allowing readers to quickly jump to your reply from the other users' comment.

In this way, readers will be able to view comments in threaded format more easily, and you will be able to more quickly find and read relevant comments in a long page.
